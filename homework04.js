//initalize variables

var height = 3;
var diameter = 4;
var volume = 0;
var surfaceArea = 0;
var unitMeasure = "units";
var slantHeight = ((diameter/2 * diameter/2) + (height * height))^(1/2);

//introduction/explanation

//prompt for unit measurement

//prompt for diameter and height
//save diameter and height to their respective variables


//calculate answer


//display answer with measurment

console.log("A cone with a height of " + height + " " + unitMeasure + " and a diameter of " + diameter + " " + unitMeasure + " will have");
console.log("volume of " + volume + " cubic " + unitMeasure);
console.log("surface area of " + surfaceArea + " square " + unitMeasure);

//All done!
