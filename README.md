# dadschool2015
This is the coding assignments that were assigned to @zobiejrz over the summer of 2015 by @zobie. The point of the coding assigments is to help @zobiejrz practice his node.js.

All of the .pdf files are assignments that @zobie received while in college, and all of the .js files are @zobiejrz work for the .pdf files. However, while .pdf files do specify the files turned in to be written in C++, @zobiejrz is using the assignments to practice/learn node.js and is instead writting the program in node.js. 

All of the C++ files are the files that @zobie made for the assignments.
